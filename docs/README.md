# OctoAcme Project Management Process Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This README gives project contributors a centralized entry point to our processes, key roles, and links to all detailed process documents in this folder. Use this page to onboard quickly, find the single source of truth for project artifacts, and learn how we run projects from initiation through continuous improvement.

OctoAcme runs projects with a structured, iterative approach that emphasizes clear ownership, measurable outcomes, and repeatable artifacts. Projects begin with a lightweight initiation phase that captures the problem, objectives, success metrics, stakeholders, and a decision gate. Planning turns approved initiatives into prioritized backlogs, release and milestone maps, and a Definition of Done. Execution follows predictable workflows (project board columns, small pull requests, CI checks, and review requirements) and ends with release and verification activities.

Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined to ensure accountability and effective collaboration. Product Managers own outcomes and prioritization, Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and stakeholder communication, developers implement and test features, and QA validates acceptance criteria and test plans. Regular cadences (daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, PM–PdM alignment, demos, and monthly stakeholder updates) provide the rhythm for coordination and escalation.

Quality assurance and risk management are continuous priorities. We require automated unit, integration, and smoke tests in CI and security scanning; manual QA for feature acceptance when needed; pre-release checklists including rollback plans and release notes; and a simple risk register updated at regular syncs. Retrospectives after sprints or releases capture action items that feed back into the backlog to continuously improve how we work.
